# Adaptive Local Binary Pattern: A Novel Feature Descriptor for Enhanced Analysis of Kidney Abnormalities in CT Scan Images using ensemble based Machine Learning Approach

# Overview

The shortage of nephrologists and the growing public health concern over renal failure have spurred the demand for AI systems capable of autonomously detecting kidney abnormalities. Renal failure, marked by a gradual decline in kidney function, can result from factors like cysts, stones, and tumors. Chronic kidney disease may go unnoticed initially, leading to untreated cases until they reach an advanced stage. The dataset, comprising 12,427 images from multiple hospitals in Dhaka, was categorized into four groups: cyst, tumor, stone, and normal. Our methodology aims to enhance CT scan image quality using Cropping, Resizing, and CALHE techniques, followed by feature extraction with our proposed Adaptive Local Binary Pattern (ALBP) feature extraction method compared with the state-of-the-art local binary pattern (LBP) method. Our proposed features fed into classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and SVM. We explored an ensemble model with soft voting to get a more robust model for our task.
