# Adaptive Local Binary Pattern: A Novel Feature Descriptor for Enhanced Analysis of Kidney Abnormalities in CT Scan Images using ensemble based Machine Learning Approach

# Overview

The shortage of nephrologists and the growing public health concern over renal failure have spurred the demand for AI systems capable of autonomously detecting kidney abnormalities. Renal failure, marked by a gradual decline in kidney function, can result from factors like cysts, stones, and tumors. Chronic kidney disease may go unnoticed initially, leading to untreated cases until they reach an advanced stage. The dataset, comprising 12,427 images from multiple hospitals in Dhaka, was categorized into four groups: cyst, tumor, stone, and normal. Our methodology aims to enhance CT scan image quality using Cropping, Resizing, and CALHE techniques, followed by feature extraction with our proposed Adaptive Local Binary Pattern (ALBP) feature extraction method compared with the state-of-the-art local binary pattern (LBP) method. Our proposed features fed into classifiers such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and SVM. We explored an ensemble model with soft voting to get a more robust model for our task.

# Dataset

12,446 unique PACS images from different hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh were included in the dataset [reference][1]. The photos showed patients with kidney tumors, cysts, normal conditions, or kidney stones. From contrast and non-contrast investigations of the whole abdomen and urogram protocols, both coronal and axial cuts were included. The DICOM data have been converted into lossless JPEG. The author of the dataset mentioned that to guarantee data accuracy, each image finding was verified by a medical technician. 3,709 photographs of cysts, 5,077 images of normal circumstances, 1,377 images of kidney stones, and 2,283 images of tumors.

# Usage

There are three folders inside this project. They are: (i) Dataset Preprocessing (ii) Proposed Feature Descriptor (iii) Model Training & Evalution. In "Model Training & Evalution" Folder there are two sub folders: (a) Adaptive Local Binary Pattern (b) Local Binary Pattern . One The explanation has given below:

### Data Preprocessing

In This folder we tried to used the data preprocessing by using the cropping, resizing and applied the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance the image's contrast.

### Proposed Feature Descriptor

Here we tried to compare the how the images are looking like after applying proposed Feature Descriptor (Adaptive Histogram Equalization(A-LBP)) and traditional Local Binary Pattern.

### Model Training & Evalution

These are the notebooks of the model training and we separate it according to it's Classifiers and Feature Descriptors. Here we renamed all the files according to "No_Feature-Extraction-Method-Name_Classifier-Name". The abbreviations we have used here for feature extraction method "LBP" means "Local Binary Pattern" and "ALBP" means "Adaptive Local Binary Pattern". For the classifiers "RF" means "Random Forest", "DT" means "Decision Tree", "NB" means "Gaussian Naive Bayes", "KNN" means "K-Nearest-Neighbor", "SVM" means "Support Vector Machine", "ENSEMBLE" means "Using Soft Voting of the five classifiers to make a robust model".
